# Usage

Replace `readme.md` with a Markdown file of your choice to be used as a detailed README for the [Upbound Marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/).

By default, the top-level README.md in the GitHub repo may be used.

The file must:

- be named `readme.md`
- contain valid Markdown content
